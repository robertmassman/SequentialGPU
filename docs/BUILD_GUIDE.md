- **Target**: Maximum performance, minimal bundle size
- **Optimizations**: 
  - All debug code eliminated
  - Performance tracking removed
  - Aggressive tree-shaking
  - Code minification
  - Fast-path optimizations
- **Expected bundle size**: <500KB
- **Queue overhead target**: <5ms

#### Debug Build (`npm run build:debug`)
- **Target**: Full development capabilities
- **Features**:
  - Comprehensive logging system
  - Performance tracking and metrics
  - Resource leak detection
  - GPU state validation
  - Detailed error reporting
- **Source maps**: Full source mapping enabled

#### Profile Build (`npm run build:profile`)
- **Target**: Production performance with essential metrics
- **Features**:
  - Core performance metrics only
  - Minimal logging overhead
  - Production optimizations with profiling data
  - Suitable for performance analysis

## Quick Start

### Development Workflow
```bash
# Start development with hot reloading
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build:production

# Build all targets
npm run build:all

# Clean previous builds
npm run clean

# Analyze bundle performance
npm run analyze

# Run performance tests
npm run performance
```

### Environment Variables

```bash
# Build target selection
BUILD_TARGET=production|debug|profile

# Node environment
NODE_ENV=production|development

# Logging level (debug builds only)
LOG_LEVEL=error|warn|info|debug|trace
```

## Performance Optimizations

### Production Optimizations Applied

1. **Queue Performance**
   - Fast-path execution for immediate operations
   - Object pooling to reduce allocations
   - Minimal overhead promise handling
   - Optimized priority queue processing

2. **GPU Operations**
   - Cached sampler creation
   - Layout key caching
   - Bind group entry optimization
   - Minimal error checking overhead

3. **Memory Management**
   - Aggressive object pooling
   - Reduced tracking overhead
   - Optimized buffer alignment calculations
   - Minimal metadata storage

4. **Code Elimination**
   - Debug logging removed
   - Performance tracking stripped
   - Assertion elimination
   - Verbose error handling removed

### Debug Features (Debug Build Only)

1. **Performance Tracking**
   - Queue operation timing
   - GPU command profiling
   - Resource allocation monitoring
   - Memory leak detection
   - Bottleneck identification

2. **Comprehensive Logging**
   - Categorized logging system
   - Performance warnings
   - GPU state debugging
   - Resource tracking
   - Real-time monitoring

3. **Development Tools**
   - Bundle analysis reports
   - Performance test suites
   - Cache statistics
   - Resource leak detection

## Build Configuration

### Rollup Configuration (`rollup.config.advanced.js`)

The advanced build configuration provides:
- Conditional compilation based on `BUILD_TARGET`
- Dead code elimination for production
- Performance optimization plugins
- Tree-shaking configuration
- Source map management

### Build Flags

Compile-time constants for conditional compilation:
- `__PRODUCTION__`: True in production builds
- `__DEBUG__`: True in debug builds  
- `__PROFILE__`: True in profile builds
- `__DEV__`: True in development mode

## Performance Targets

### Queue Performance Goals
- **Production**: <5ms average queue overhead
- **Debug**: <10ms with full tracking
- **Throughput**: >1000 operations/second

### Memory Efficiency Goals
- **Memory leaks**: 0 detected leaks
- **Allocation efficiency**: >90% release rate
- **Object pooling**: >70% reuse rate

### Bundle Size Goals
- **Production**: <500KB minified
- **Debug**: <1MB with source maps
- **Compression**: >70% gzip ratio

## Monitoring and Analysis

### Bundle Analysis (`npm run analyze`)
Provides detailed analysis of:
- Bundle size comparison across builds
- Tree-shaking effectiveness
- Optimization verification
- Performance feature detection
- Actionable recommendations

### Performance Testing (`npm run performance`)
Comprehensive benchmarking of:
- Queue operation performance
- Memory allocation patterns
- Fast-path efficiency
- Object pooling effectiveness
- Cache performance metrics

### Real-time Monitoring (Debug builds)
- Performance bottleneck detection
- Resource leak alerts
- Queue health monitoring
- GPU operation profiling

## Integration with CI/CD

### GitHub Actions Example
```yaml
name: Build and Test
on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: '18'
      
      - run: npm install
      - run: npm run build:all
      - run: npm run analyze
      - run: npm run performance
      
      - name: Upload build artifacts
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
        with:
          name: build-artifacts
          path: public/
```

### Performance Regression Detection
The build system includes automated performance regression detection:
- Queue overhead monitoring
- Bundle size tracking
- Memory efficiency verification
- Performance benchmark comparison

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **High queue overhead**: 
   - Check for debug code in production builds
   - Verify fast-path optimizations are active
   - Review object allocation patterns

2. **Large bundle sizes**:
   - Ensure tree-shaking is working correctly
   - Verify debug code elimination
   - Check for unused dependencies

3. **Memory leaks**:
   - Enable resource tracking in debug builds
   - Monitor object pool efficiency
   - Check for unclosed resources

### Debug Commands
```bash
# Analyze specific bundle
node scripts/analyze-bundle.js

# Test performance with detailed output
node scripts/performance-test.js

# Check build configuration
BUILD_TARGET=debug npm run build:debug -- --verbose
```

## API Compatibility

The build system maintains 100% API compatibility across all build targets:
- Same public interfaces
- Graceful degradation of debug features
- Consistent behavior in all environments
- No breaking changes between builds

## Future Enhancements

Planned improvements:
- WebAssembly integration for critical paths
- Advanced caching strategies
- Build-time shader optimization
- Automated performance regression testing
- Real-time performance dashboards
